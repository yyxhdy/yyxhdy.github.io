I am a Postdoctoral Fellow (work with Prof. [Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/))
at Michigan State University, USA. 
I received the Ph.D. degree 
(Advisor: Prof. [Bo Zhang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101226104412516277601/20101226104412516277601_.html)) 
from Tsinghua University, China, in July 2015. From January 2014 to January 2015, 
I was a visiting Ph.D. student (Advisor: Prof. [Xin Yao](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/))
at University of Birmingham, UK. I was a Research Fellow (worked with Prof. [Yew-Soon Ong](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asysong/)) 
at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, from October 2015 to December 2016. 
My research interests lie at the intersection of computational intelligence, 
software engineering, and operations research. Currently I am interested in the following topics:
* Automatic program repair/synthesis
* Genetic improvement
* Evolutionary multi/many-objective optimizatoin 
* Evolutionary multi-task optimization
* Bayesian optimization 
* Intelligent scheduling in job-shop environments
